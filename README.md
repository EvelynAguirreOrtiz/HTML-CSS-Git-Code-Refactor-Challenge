### Purpose

 To refactor a website for the marketing agency Horiseon. One of the links was not working and there were no accessible alt tags. The code did not have semantic HTML tags and there were also some coding typos.
 
 Where applicable, alt tags have been added to make the website more accessible. The semamtic HTML elements have been modified where needed to better describe the structure of the website.
 
 All links are now functioning correctly with the addition of missing selectors. 
 
 The CSS has been cleaned up by organizing the code to follow the HTML structure and by consolidating several selectors and properties.
