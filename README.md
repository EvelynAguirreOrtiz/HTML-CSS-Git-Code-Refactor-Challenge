# Horiseon Website
## Code Refactor Challenge

For this challenge, I needed to refactor a website for the marketing agency Horiseon, using using HTML and CSS. One of the links was not working and the website had no accessible alt tags.

Where applicable, alt tags have been added to make the website more accessible. The semamtic HTML elements have been modified where needed to better describe the structure of the website.

All links are now functioning correctly with the addition of missing selectors. 

The CSS has been cleaned up by orgnizing the code to follow the HTML structure and by consolidating several selectors and properties.
